# Object-Tracker-Using-Yolo-Neural-Network

Object identification and recognition on a machine require a great deal of computation to retrieve any knowledge about the shapes and structures in an image. So, today we are going to build a real-time object detection model with a modified YOLO neural network.

Object Identification and detection in a computer vision is the process of finding and recognizing an object in an image or video. The key steps involved in object detection are:

* Feature Extraction
* Feature Processing
* Feature Extraction
